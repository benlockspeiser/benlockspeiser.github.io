				<h2>PM Certifications & Programs</h2>
				<p>PMs often get bundled into other forms of management like Project Managers; they are similar but not the same, but for certification purposes, they are!  The PMP certification is the most widely recognized certification available in the industry.  Another up and comer is the Certified Scrum Master, or CSM for short.  Agile project management is the key to effectively and expeditiously completing tasks and larger projects!  Below are the certifications and programs that can help you become a better PM.
